# pi-observational-memory

> **Make Pi sessions feel endless.**

`pi-observational-memory` is a Pi extension that keeps long agent sessions coherent across compactions, handoffs, and days of work.

It helps Pi remember what matters while you work, so your agent does not lose the thread when the session gets long.

Built for engineers who use Pi for real coding work: multi-day refactors, deep debugging sessions, architecture exploration, migrations, product implementation, and long-running branches where context matters.

---

## The problem

Long AI coding sessions eventually hit a wall.

Not because the agent stops being useful. Not because the work is too complex. But because the session starts getting compressed.

A compaction summarizes the session. Later, another compaction summarizes that summary. Then another. After enough cycles, your agent is no longer carrying the real working context. It is carrying a compressed version of a compressed version of a compressed version.

That is when the small but important details start disappearing:

* why a design decision was made
* what approaches were already rejected
* which constraint mattered most
* what the current branch is trying to achieve
* what the user already clarified
* what the agent already investigated
* what should not be reopened

The session is still alive, but it no longer feels connected to the work that came before.

For engineers, that is painful. Long coding sessions are built out of accumulated decisions. When those decisions lose their rationale, the agent starts drifting.

---

## The second problem: slow compaction

Compaction can also break flow.

You are deep in a coding session, the agent needs to compact, and suddenly you wait while a model rewrites the past. In large sessions, that pause can take minutes.

That interruption is costly because it happens exactly when the session is already complex and you most need continuity.

`pi-observational-memory` changes the experience: memory work happens as the session progresses, so when compaction time arrives, Pi can move forward quickly.

The goal is simple:

> When compaction happens, you should barely notice.

---

## What this extension gives you

`pi-observational-memory` continuously captures useful session memory while you work.

It focuses on two simple concepts:

### Observations

Observations are concrete things that happened or were established during the session.

Examples:

* the user decided to switch from REST to GraphQL
* the migration was completed and validated
* a bug was traced to a specific module
* a branch is focused on replacing one implementation with another
* a deadline, constraint, or preference was stated

Observations keep the session grounded in actual work.

### Reflections

Reflections are durable facts distilled from observations.

Examples:

* the user is building a Next.js 15 dashboard with Supabase auth
* the current implementation must ship by a specific date
* the project prefers minimal abstractions over framework-heavy patterns
* the branch is about improving long-session agent memory

Reflections help the agent stay oriented over time. The reflector treats coverage as stewardship: every active observation it reviews includes a `none`, `partial`, or `strong` coverage tier, but those tiers are review context rather than quotas. When the reflector emits a durable reflection, its support ids should cover all and only the observations whose durable meaning is actually preserved, because those ids later become dropper coverage evidence.

Together, observations and reflections let Pi carry the important parts of the session forward without depending on fragile summary chains.

---

## What it feels like

With `pi-observational-memory`, long sessions feel less like racing against the context window and more like working with an agent that can stay with you.

You can keep a session alive across many compactions. You can come back after a long break. You can hand work across sessions with less context loss. The agent has a better chance of remembering what was decided, what matters, and why the work is shaped the way it is.

This extension was built from real long-session usage, including Pi sessions that lasted for weeks without feeling close to the end of the usable working context.

The promise is not magic infinite memory.

The promise is practical continuity:

> Your agent keeps understanding the work, even after days of iteration.

---

## Why it works

Traditional compaction asks a model to rewrite the past at the moment the context window needs relief.

`pi-observational-memory` does the important memory work earlier, while the session is still happening.

As you work, the extension captures observations and distills reflections in the background. When Pi needs to compact, the memory is already prepared. Compaction becomes a fast rendering step instead of a slow summarization event.

That gives you two big benefits:

1. **Less coherence loss** — important context is preserved as observations and reflections instead of repeatedly compressed through summary chains.
2. **Faster compaction** — the expensive memory work happens before compaction, not while you are waiting.

---

## Example

At compaction time, Pi may receive memory like this:

```md
These are condensed memories from earlier in this session.

- Reflections: stable, long-lived facts about the user, project, decisions, and constraints. New reflection lines may include ids in brackets.
- Observations: timestamped events from the conversation history, in chronological order. Observation lines include ids in brackets.

Treat these as past records. When entries conflict, the most recent observation reflects the latest known state. Work that prior observations describe as completed should not be redone unless the user explicitly asks to revisit it.

When exact source context is needed for precision or traceability, use the recall tool with the relevant observation or reflection id. This is especially useful when a reflection materially affects a decision or is too compressed to continue confidently. Do not use recall as broad search or inject raw source unless it is needed.

## Reflections
[a1b2c3d4e5f6] User works at Acme Corp building Acme Dashboard on Next.js 15 with Supabase auth.
[b2c3d4e5f6a1] Hard constraint: ship by January 22nd 2026.

## Observations
[d4e5f6a1b2c3] 2026-01-15 14:30 [high] User decided to switch from REST to GraphQL for the public API; motivation was reducing over-fetching on mobile clients.
[e5f6a1b2c3d4] 2026-01-15 14:50 [medium] GraphQL migration completed; user confirmed queries working.
```

The IDs are useful because the agent-facing `recall` tool can recover source evidence for a specific observation or reflection.

That means memory is not just a vague statement. The agent can look back at the evidence behind it.

---

## Who this is for

Use `pi-observational-memory` if you use Pi for:

* long coding sessions
* multi-day feature work
* architecture exploration
* large refactors
* production debugging
* repository migrations
* agent-assisted planning
* sessions that need to survive many compactions
* workflows where handoff quality matters

This extension is especially useful when the session contains decisions that should survive over time.

---

## Install

Requires Pi 0.81.0 or newer. Proactive compaction uses the `agent_settled` lifecycle event introduced in that release.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-observational-memory
```

Or install from GitHub/local development:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/elpapi42/pi-observational-memory
# or, from a local checkout:
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-observational-memory
```

Pi loads the extension from `src/index.ts` through the package `pi.extensions` entry.

---

## Quick configuration

Settings live under the `observational-memory` namespace in either:

* `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
* project-local `.pi/settings.json`

Project settings override global settings.

`PI_OBSERVATIONAL_MEMORY_PASSIVE` can override only `passive`.

The observer supports ordered text and actual image payloads from user messages, tool results, and custom messages when the selected worker model accepts images. Source labels and MIME types are preserved; incompatible models/fallbacks, unknown blocks, and over-budget inputs cannot advance coverage. Reflector/dropper remain text-only. See [input budgets](docs/configuration.md#observerchunkmaxtokens) and [captured provider replay](docs/multimodal-replay.md).

Hosts disable memory by excluding the extension from the Pi run, not by setting passive mode. Re-enabling after ordinary Pi compaction is supported when the intact raw branch is available; omitted, uncovered source is re-observed before memory-based compaction can discard it. Summary-only imports are not supported. Hosts own per-session defaults, durable settings, turn snapshots, and fork inheritance. See [resume behavior](docs/how-it-works.md#disable-re-enable-and-resume).

A typical config:

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "observeAfterTokens": 10000,
    "reflectAfterTokens": 20000,
    "compactAfterTokens": 81000,
    "compactAfterTokensMode": "calibrated",
    "compactAfterTokensRatio": 0.68,
    "observationsPoolMaxTokens": 20000,
    "observationsPoolTargetTokens": 10000,
    "agentMaxTurns": 16,
    "model": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "id": "google/gemma-4-31b-it",
      "thinking": "low"
    },
    "fallbackModel": {
      "provider": "opencode-go",
      "id": "deepseek-v4.1-flash",
      "thinking": "low"
    },
    "showWorkerNotifications": true,
    "passive": false,
    "debugLog": false
  }
}
```

Most users can start with the defaults and tune only if they have a specific reason.

If your memory model is a local llama.cpp server, size `agentMaxTokens` so that a worst-case request (observer chunk + prior memory + system prompt + the full response budget) fits inside the server's context: slot KV is shared between the main session's retained cache and concurrent sub-agent requests, so an over-budget sub-agent request fails with `500 "Context size has been exceeded."` and the affected memory run aborts. For example, on a 64K-slot server, pairing `"agentMaxTokens": 8192` with a low `observerChunkMaxTokens` keeps sub-agent requests well inside the window.

### Scaling compaction to the model's context window

By default `compactAfterTokensMode` is `"calibrated"`, so the proactive
compaction trigger uses the fixed `compactAfterTokens` estimated source-entry
threshold (81,000 by default). This preserves the pre-PR #40 compaction metric
for typical ~128K–200K context models.

On a large-context model (e.g. 1M tokens) the calibrated default preempts
compaction at ~81K, wasting most of the window. Switch to `"ratio"` mode to let
the trigger scale with the active model's `contextWindow`:

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "compactAfterTokens": 81000,
    "compactAfterTokensMode": "ratio",
    "compactAfterTokensRatio": 0.5
  }
}
```

In ratio mode the effective threshold is
`floor(model.contextWindow * compactAfterTokensRatio)` (clamped to a minimum of
1). With the example above, a 1,000,000-token window compacts after about
500,000 estimated source-entry tokens after the latest compaction boundary; a
200,000-token window uses about 100,000. The threshold counts source entries,
not Pi's system prompt, tool schemas, or provider accounting. Pi's native
window-pressure compaction remains independent.

`compactAfterTokensRatio` is user-tunable precisely because **context window ≠
attention**. Some models advertise a large window but degrade at long range; set
a lower ratio (e.g. `0.4`) to compact earlier on those, or a higher ratio
(e.g. `0.7`) on models that stay sharp. The default ratio is `0.68`.

`compactAfterTokens` is always retained as the fallback: in `"calibrated"`
mode it is the threshold directly, and in `"ratio"` mode it is used whenever
the active model's `contextWindow` is unavailable (undefined, 0, or negative),
so compaction still triggers safely. `/om:status` shows the resolved threshold
on the `Next compaction` line regardless of mode.

### Defaults

| Setting                     | Default       | Meaning                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `observeAfterTokens`        | `10000`       | Raw/source token threshold for observation runs.                                                  |
| `observerChunkMaxTokens`    | derived       | Max estimated tokens serialized into one observer chunk (minimum `256`). Unset: `floor(contextWindow * 0.2)` of the resolved memory model, or `60000` when the window is unknown. Larger backlogs drain oldest-first. An individual source that only fits as an excerpt blocks observation/compaction until the budget is raised. |
| `reflectAfterTokens`        | `20000`       | Raw/source token threshold for reflection runs; successful reflection creates dropper opportunities. |
| `compactAfterTokens`        | `81000`       | Estimated source-entry threshold for proactive auto-compaction, counted after the latest compaction boundary. |
| `compactAfterTokensMode`    | `"calibrated"`| `"calibrated"` uses `compactAfterTokens` directly. `"ratio"` scales the source-entry threshold by the active model's `contextWindow`. |
| `compactAfterTokensRatio`   | `0.68`        | In `"ratio"` mode, the threshold is `floor(contextWindow * ratio)`. Tunable because large windows do not always mean strong long-range attention. Must be in `(0, 1)`. |
| `observationsPoolMaxTokens` | `20000`       | Observation-token budget used for compaction full-fold pressure.                                  |
| `observationsPoolTargetTokens` | half of max | Active observation target used by post-reflection dropper maintenance.                            |
| `agentMaxTurns`             | `16`          | Shared turn cap for background memory-agent loops.                                                |
| `agentMaxTokens`            | `32000`       | Maximum output tokens requested for memory-agent loops (observer/reflector/dropper), clamped to the model's own `maxTokens` when available. Lower it for local servers with a modest context window, e.g. `8192`. |
| `model`                     | session model | Optional memory-worker model override: `{ provider, id, thinking }`.                              |
| `fallbackModel`             | unset         | Optional second memory-worker model: `{ provider, id, thinking }`. Used when the primary memory model fails to resolve, and to retry a worker stage once when its model call errors. |
| `showWorkerNotifications`   | `true`        | Shows routine observer, reflector, and dropper progress notifications. Warnings and errors are unaffected. |
| `passive`                   | `false`       | Disables proactive background observation, reflection, maintenance, and auto-compaction triggers. |
| `debugLog`                  | `false`       | Writes opt-in per-session extension debug events to Pi's agent directory.                         |

Valid `model.thinking` values are:

* `off`
* `minimal`
* `low`
* `medium`
* `high`
* `xhigh`
* `max`

If no `model` is configured, memory workers use the session model, including custom `pi.registerProvider` APIs such as `cursor-sdk`. You do not need a second built-in provider (OpenAI, OpenRouter, …) for observational memory to run. Set `model` only when you want cheaper or faster workers than the coding agent.

Set `fallbackModel` when the memory model may be unavailable: it is tried when the primary memory model cannot be resolved (unknown provider/model or no usable credentials), and a worker stage that errors mid-call is retried once with it. Once the fallback is used, it stays active for the rest of the consolidation pass. With no `fallbackModel` configured, a failed memory model skips or fails safely exactly as before.

Set `showWorkerNotifications` to `false` to hide routine worker start and completion messages (including deliberate-empty observer info messages). Model fallback/unavailability, worker failures (including observer stream errors), compaction notifications, and explicit `/om:*` command output remain visible.

`observationsPoolMaxTokens` and `observationsPoolTargetTokens` intentionally describe different pools. Max tokens control when compaction performs a full fold over visible memory. Target tokens control the folded active observation pool that the dropper maintains after successful reflection. If the target is omitted, it defaults to half of max.

Dropper pruning balances age, relevance, and reflection coverage. Relevance is importance/resistance, not a permanent active-memory pin: `critical` observations require the strongest evidence but can be dropped when they are older and safely represented by reflections, superseded by newer memory, redundant, or obsolete. Dropper input annotates each active observation with deterministic coverage evidence: `none`, `partial`, or `strong`; coverage guides model judgment and is not an automatic drop rule. Dropping removes observations from active memory, not ledger history.

When `debugLog` is enabled, debug events are written as local NDJSON files under Pi's agent directory. Normal sessions write to `observational-memory/debug/<session-id>.ndjson`; contexts without a session id fall back to `observational-memory/debug.ndjson`. Debug rows include `sessionId` and per-consolidation `runId`, so a session file can still be filtered to one observer/reflector/dropper run.

## Commands and agent tool

| Surface             | What it does                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/om:status`        | Shows memory counts, plain `+N` / `-N` visible/full drift suffixes, progress clocks, visible and active observation pool pressure, passive/in-flight state, and last worker errors. |
| `/om:view`          | Shows current visible memory and attempts to copy the rendered memory text to the clipboard.                                                   |
| `/om:view full`     | Shows the full current memory state for the branch and attempts to copy the rendered memory text to the clipboard.                             |
| `recall` agent tool | Recovers source evidence for a 12-character observation/reflection id on the current branch. It is not semantic search or a transcript browser. |

`/om:view` copies only the rendered memory content. The success/failure line shown in Pi is not included in the clipboard text. If clipboard support is unavailable, the command still prints the memory view and shows a warning. Before the first V3 compaction, visible memory can be empty because nothing has been folded into `om.folded` details; use `/om:view full` to inspect recorded branch memory.

## How it works in 60 seconds

```

The high-level lifecycle:

1. Pi session continues normally.
2. The extension captures observations from the session as work happens.
3. Durable reflections are distilled in the background.
4. When compaction time arrives, Pi receives prepared memory quickly.
5. The agent continues with a compact but useful view of the work so far.

The important part: compaction does not need to rethink the whole session from scratch.

The proactive compaction threshold counts estimated source-entry tokens after
the latest compaction boundary. It includes source entries retained by
`firstKeptEntryId` and newer source entries, while memory ledger entries and
compaction metadata contribute zero. `/om:status` uses the same metric. Pi's
own window-pressure compaction remains independent.

---

## Current V3 behavior

Current behavior:

* **Observation-centered memory.** The extension records useful session observations while you work.
* **Durable reflections.** The extension distills stable facts that help the agent stay oriented over time.
* **Safe, fast compaction.** `session_before_compact` renders committed V3 memory without calling a model or waiting for background workers. Pi's desired cutoff is clamped to committed observer coverage; empty memory or an unsafe boundary cancels compaction and retains raw history.
* **Background memory work.** Observation and reflection work run from `turn_end` when their token clocks are due; dropper work runs only after successful reflection and prunes the folded active observation ledger toward `observationsPoolTargetTokens`.
* **Source-backed recall.** Observations and reflections can be traced back through the `recall` tool.
* **Visible/full views.** `/om:view` shows visible memory and `/om:view full` shows the full current memory state. Use `/om:status` for visible-vs-full drift and for the separate visible observation pool vs active observation pool.
* **No V2 compatibility layer.** Old V2 settings and memory entries are ignored rather than migrated.

---

## Migrating from V2

V3 is **not backwards compatible** with V2 memory or settings.

What this means in practice:

1. **Update your settings.** V2 keys are silently ignored by V3. Keeping the old names will make V3 fall back to defaults.
2. **Start a new clean Pi session after upgrading.** Existing sessions may still contain old visible compaction-summary text until a new V3 compaction replaces what the agent sees, so a clean session is the safest migration path.
3. **Do not expect rollback continuity.** If you create V3 memory entries and then roll back to V2, V2 will not understand the V3 memory format. Treat that as memory reset/visibility loss.

### Settings migration table

Example V2 config:

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "observationThresholdTokens": 1000,
    "compactionThresholdTokens": 50000,
    "reflectionThresholdTokens": 30000,
    "compactionModel": { "provider": "openrouter", "id": "google/gemma-4-31b-it" },
    "thinkingLevel": "low",
    "observerMaxTurnsPerRun": 8,
    "reflectorMaxTurnsPerPass": 12,
    "prunerMaxTurnsPerPass": 12,
    "passive": false
  }
}
```

V3 equivalent:

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "observeAfterTokens": 10000,
    "reflectAfterTokens": 20000,
    "compactAfterTokens": 81000,
    "observationsPoolMaxTokens": 20000,
    "observationsPoolTargetTokens": 10000,
    "agentMaxTurns": 12,
    "model": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "id": "google/gemma-4-31b-it",
