# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Model auth (OAuth vs API key)

`src/runtime.ts` `resolveModel` must accept auth that carries EITHER an `apiKey` OR non-empty
`headers` (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer …`). Pi's OAuth providers (kimi-coding, xai, openai-codex,
anthropic OAuth, …) return headers-only auth from `getApiKeyAndHeaders`, and pi-ai providers treat a
caller-supplied `Authorization` header as a substitute apiKey. The acceptance rule mirrors pi's own
`AgentSession._getRequiredRequestAuth` (`result.auth.apiKey || result.auth.headers`). Do not
re-introduce a hard `apiKey` requirement — it breaks compaction/consolidation for every OAuth model.
Tests: `npm test` (vitest); typecheck: `npm run typecheck`.

## Fallback model (`fallbackModel`)

`config.fallbackModel` is a second memory-worker model. It is tried in two places, both in
`src/runtime.ts` + `src/hooks/consolidation-trigger.ts`:

- Resolution (`Runtime.resolveModel` → `resolveFallbackModel`): used when the primary memory model
  (config `model`, else session model) is missing from the registry or has no usable auth.
- Runtime (`runStageWithFallback`): a worker stage that throws is retried once with the fallback.

`makeModelResolver` caches the fallback for the rest of the pass once it resolves, and a stage whose
result already carries `fallbackUsed: true` is never retried again. Keep `resolveCandidate` as the
single place that applies Pi's auth acceptance rule — both the primary and fallback paths must share
it. Do not make the fallback mandatory: with none configured, the previous skip/fail-safe behavior
must be byte-for-byte unchanged (covered by `tests/runtime.test.ts` and `tests/consolidation-trigger.test.ts`).

## Multimodal observation and resume

`src/serialize.ts` returns both diagnostic `text` and ordered observer `content`.
Never deliver its placeholder-containing `text` for image-bearing chunks. Image
requests are guarded in `src/image-budget.ts` before every provider call; fallback
must independently support images. Reflector/dropper stay textual.

Pi native compaction retains raw ledger history. Resume recovery must read
`getBranch()`, not the compacted model projection, and never treat native summaries
as observer coverage. Supported re-enable/fork behavior is in
`docs/how-it-works.md#disable-re-enable-and-resume`. Live replay is opt-in via
`scripts/replay-observer.mjs`; tests/tooling require Node 22.19+.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.

<!-- opm:managed:start -->
- The user prefers narrow fixes that preserve unrelated improvements. For ambiguous semantics, the user wants options and tradeoffs first, then autonomous implementation, validation, and a focused pull request.
- Compaction, consolidation, and memory storage use separate token domains. `compactAfterTokens` measures estimated source entries after the compaction boundary, while observation and reflection scheduling can use provider deltas. Pool, serialized-input, stored-memory, and output limits use local estimates. Changes to token accounting must align the trigger, status, documentation, and tests. The diagnostic runbook is `.pi/skills/diagnose-compaction-trigger`.
- Pi exposes aggregate active-context usage, not exact token attribution for an entry or entry-ID range. Its exported range-capable estimator uses a character heuristic, so provider context cannot replace raw-entry counting without changing semantics.
- Pi context pressure and compactable history are separate conditions. Extension-requested `ctx.compact()` can fail before `session_before_compact` when Pi finds no removable range, while Pi-native compaction handles this path separately.
- `firstKeptEntryId` is a retention boundary, not a zero-progress boundary. Retained source entries can already exceed `compactAfterTokens`, so cadence changes must test consecutive post-success turns and distinguish successful repetition from failed-attempt backoff.
